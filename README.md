#  Detection of Breast Cancer Using Microstrip Patch Antenna â€“ CST Studio Suite
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a 33 GHz microstrip patch antenna for the non-invasive detection of breast cancer using CST Studio Suite 2024. The antenna is developed to sense changes in dielectric properties between normal and cancerous breast tissues through electromagnetic interaction.

A 3-layer breast phantom (skin, fat, and tumor) is modeled to simulate realistic human tissue conditions. The simulation includes comprehensive analysis of S-parameters (S11 and S21), along with return loss, gain, and radiation pattern. These parameters help assess the antenna's ability to detect tumors based on reflection and transmission behavior. The project highlights the potential of microwave antenna-based diagnostics in biomedical imaging applications.
